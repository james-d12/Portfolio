# Overview

Panda is a financial planning and anaylsis web application built from the ground up to address the required business needs to track and manage budgets across all sectors of the business. I worked with the Finance Team, I.T team and my manager to take it from the design phase all the way to the delivery phase. I used the agile methodology which allowed the development to respond more rapidly to the evergrowing changes and needs of the product as it's requirements where not set in stone.

# How was it built?

Panda was built using the following:

- Built with React.js and Material UI.
- REST API backend built using Express.js & TypeScript
- Database designed and implemented using Prisma.io
- API testing using Jest and Supertest.
- Integration tests using GitHub Actions
